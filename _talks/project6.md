we present a novel model-free reinforcement learning approach for solving a conventional leader-follower problem using autonomous wheeled mobile robots. Specifically, the proposed learning approach will determine the linear velocity and the steering angle (control actions) of a follower robot so that it can follow the time-varying motion trajectory of a leader robot.
