The mechanical and surface properties of PCL-based nanofiber mats are investigated using a Nanosurf C3000 atomic force microscope (AFM). One batch of PCL mats were coated with collagen, while the uncoated mats were used as controls. The cell behavior and material property values obtained from the uncoated PCL and collagen-coated PCL mats were analyzed and compared.
