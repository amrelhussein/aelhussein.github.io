In this project, we invented an optimized design for the University of Khartoum Space Research Centre UOKSat3 structure. The design was obtained by performing topology optimization of the CubeSat using finite element software package (ANSYS 18.2) to serve as a foundation for using 3D printing technologies for manufacturing the CubeSat structures on the quest for reducing the cost and mass of the structure along with maintaining its strength during the launch environments.
